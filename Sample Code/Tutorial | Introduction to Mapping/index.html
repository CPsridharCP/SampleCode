		// Declare a global variable ip and set its value to a string with your robot's IP address.
		const ip = "<robotipaddress>";
		// Declare a global variable pixelsPerGrid and set its value to 10. This variable is used in the drawMap() function to determine the size (in pixels) of the map. Adjust this value to change the size of the map.
		const pixelsPerGrid = 10;
		// Define a global variable to keep track of whether we are subscribed to the event.
		let subscribed = false;
		// Use global variables to keep track of whether Misty is ready to start mapping. Define the global variable ready near the top of the program and initialize it as false.

		/* CALLBACKS */

		// Define the function passed as the callback to the new instance of LightSocket. This is the code that executes when socket opens a connection to your robot.
		function openCallback() {
			// Call subscribeSelfState() to subscribe to SelfState events only after you establish a connection to Misty.
			subscribeSelfState();
			// Call the startMapping() function to start mapping after the event subscription is established.

					console.log("runMode: " + runMode);
					// Write a switch statement that checks the value of runMode. If it is equal to the string "Ready", break from the statement and do nothing ("Ready" is the initial state of the sensor). If it is equal to "Exploring", pose is obtained and Misty is ready to start driving around to collect map data. In this case we want to update ready to true to break the while loop within getMap() and continue execution in that function.

		/* WEBSOCKET SUBSCRIPTION FUNCTIONS */
		// Create a function called subscribeSelfState() to subscribe to SelfState events.
		function subscribeSelfState() {
			// Call socket.Subscribe(). Pass "SlamStatus" for the eventName argument and "SelfState" for msgType. Pass 5000 for debounceMS to tell Misty to send a SelfState message every 5 seconds. Pass null for the property,inequality, and value arguments. For the returnProperty argument, enter the string "slamStatus" to trim the message to include only the desired SLAM status data. For eventCallback, pass _SelfState as the name of the callback function to run when you receive data from this subscription.
			socket.Subscribe("SlamStatus", "SelfState", 5000, null, null, null, "slamStatus", _SelfState);

		// Define unsubscribeSelfState() to unsubscribe from the SelfState event. Call socket.Unsubscribe() within the function, passing the string "SlamStatus" (the name given the SelfState event).
