# Getting Started with Arduino

In this folder are the necessary files for getting started with sending and receiving data between Misty II and the Arduino Backpack. The 3 files you'll be using are:

- ArduinoGettingStarted.js
- ArduinoGettingStarted.json
- ArduinoGettingStartedSketch.ino

## Sending a receiving messages between Misty and Arduino Uno

1. First you'll want to load the ArduinoGettingStarted.js and  ArduinoGettingStarted.json onto your robot
1. Next you'll want to load the ArduinoGettingStartedSketch.ino sketch file onto your Arduino. If you are using the official Misty Arduino Backpack, be sure to select 'Arduino Uno' as your board in the Arduino IDE.
1. When you have your skills loaded and the arduino started, you should be all set!
