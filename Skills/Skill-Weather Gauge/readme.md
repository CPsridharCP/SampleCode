# Weather Gauge

This skill uses the APIXU API to get the weather of Misty's current location. Response data is grouped into one of five general "weather types", and Misty plays a sound and changes her eyes in response to the "weather type" of her current location.

This skill requires the audio files in `./assets/sounds` to be on your robot. You can use the [API Explorer](http://api-explorer.mistyrobotics.com) to [upload audio files to Misty](https://docs.mistyrobotics.com/onboarding/apps/api-explorer/#adding-a-custom-audio-or-image-file-to-misty).

Note that you must also generate a unique API key in order to use the APIXU API. You can [sign up for a free account with APIXU]((https://www.apixu.com/signup.aspx)) to receive an API key.
